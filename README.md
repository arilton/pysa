PYSA, also known as Python Sorting Algorithms is a collection of sorting
algorithms written in Python for the merely purpose of passing time :-)

It's just for fun, so please do not take it seriously. I won't spend much time
in this repository, but I will try to add as much sorting algorithms as
possible.
