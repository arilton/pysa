def bubble_sort(l, optimized=False):
    ''' Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting
    algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares
    each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which
    indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison
    sort, is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the
    list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for
    most problems even when compared to insertion sort.'''
